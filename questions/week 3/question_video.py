''' You want to make a cGPA calculator to calculate the average GPA over
the 6 required courses in your first year.

Write a program that takes the GPA for 6 courses from the user, and prints
the average of those GPAs. Don't forget to indicate to the user how they
should input the GPAs by using a prompt when asking for input, as follows:
    input("some prompt for the user")

Example:
    If the GPAs given by the user are: 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.1
    The expected output is: 3.35

Here are the concepts you might need to use to solve this question:
    - Accumulators
    - Counted for loops

Don't forget to check your code by running a few examples, including the one
given above. '''
