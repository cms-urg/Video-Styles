'''Universal Technological Security Company (UTSC)
is developing a user authentication system. They want to ensure that the
provided email addresses are valid according to certain rules. A valid email
address should meet the following criteria:

1. It should be more than 6 characters long
2. It should contain the @ symbol
3. The last 3 characters should be '.ca'. Note this requires the address to be
   at least three characters long.

Write a Python function named is_valid_email that takes an email address
as input and returns True if it's a valid email address based on the rules.
If it doesn't meet all the rules, return False.

Example:
    is_valid_email('john.doe@mail.utoronto.ca')
    >>> True

    is_valid_email('@b')
    >>> False

Here are the concepts you might need to use to solve this question:
    - String indexing
    - If statements

Don't forget to check your code by running a few examples, including the ones
given above. '''
